{"name":"daydream bbs","tagline":"daydream bbs - telnet / ssh / ftp","body":"## Welcome to the hosted space for DayDream BBS.\r\n\r\n## Current version: 2.20.0-RC\r\n\r\nThere is a code freeze in the works. There will only be slight bug fixes to\r\nthe current version. The roadmap for the future involves a significant re-\r\nwrite to the software, changing the backend database and frontend API.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Installation instructions:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/ryanfantus/daydream.git`\r\n\r\n(These are admittedly pretty sparse! It's a work in progress!)\r\n\r\n- Initial installation -\r\n\r\nmove into daydream-2.20.0 directory\r\nas root, \r\n`sh install.sh`\r\ncheck out docs/ directory for specifics regarding inetd, xinetd, etc\r\n\r\n- Upgrade from 2.14.9 -\r\n\r\nthis may break! pretty untested!\r\nAs root, \r\n`sh upgrade.sh`\r\n\r\nThis will ONLY copy over the new sets of binaries.  No cfg, gfx, data,\r\ndocs, or any other files will be replaced.  I suggest you do a full backup\r\nbefore you attempt this!  Now, everything *should* be backwards compatible\r\nwith your old daydream setup.  However, I make no guarantees!  ;)\r\n\r\nYou should manually do the following:\r\n\r\n1. In your display/iso/edituser.txt|gfx files, add a selection:\r\n   12 - Change message signature\r\n\r\n   This will launch the door doors/autosig %N\r\n\r\n   Feel free to add it as a main menu option as well.\r\n\r\n   Also, either copy the autosigtop.txt|gfx files from this archive,\r\n   or create your own, and put it in the display/iso dir as well.\r\n\r\n2. To use the new FR / NEW door, add FR and NEW as door options to\r\n   daydream.cfg.  Make them both similar to this:\r\n\r\n   `DOOR_COMMAND.. NEW`\r\n   `DOOR_TYPE..... 1`\r\n   `DOOR_SECURITY. 5`\r\n   `DOOR_EXECUTE.. /home/bbs/doors/new %N`\r\n   `DOOR_CONFS1... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\r\n   `DOOR_CONFS2... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\r\n   `DOOR_PASSWD... -`\r\n   `+`\r\n   `DOOR_COMMAND.. FR`\r\n   `DOOR_TYPE..... 1`\r\n   `DOOR_SECURITY. 5`\r\n   `DOOR_EXECUTE.. /home/bbs/doors/new %N`\r\n   `DOOR_CONFS1... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\r\n   `DOOR_CONFS2... XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`\r\n   `DOOR_PASSWD... -`\r\n\r\nThat's it! Enjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
